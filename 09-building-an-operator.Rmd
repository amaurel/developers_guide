# Building an operator app

## Designing the operator {-}

Tercen allows programmers to easily build new operators from the comfort of their favorite interactive development environment (IDE). From the IDE it is possible to access all Tercen features. The ability to access the input data (from Tercen) and returning results (to Tercen) is essential.  

The ability to create a new Tercen operator requires basic programming skills.

Here is a development process to create an __operator app__:

__Design the operator__:


## Coding the operator {-}

__Creating the project__:

* Open R Studio and create an empty project and init the git
* Copy four files into project, you can find them in any operator in tercen github.
    + `operator.json`
    + `main.R`
    + `README.md`
    + `.gitignore`
* Modify appropriately each of the files 
* Create  the `workspace.R` file by:
    + Copy `main.R` and rename to `workspace.R` file
    + Add the following lines to `workspace.R` file:
```
source('~/.Rprofile')
options("tercen.workflowId"= "76a4dcffd551802fd23d42bd862e8300")
options("tercen.stepId"= "3-2")
```
The values indicated above are examples. The real values come from the next section.

__Writing and testing the operator app__:

* Develop and test the __operator app__ within the `workspace.R` file
* Determine the input data for the __operator app__
    + Start Tercen
    + Use the browser to go to http://127.0.0.1:5400
    + Login
    + Go to the workflow which contains the data
    + Add a __data step__
    + Configure a project view in cross-tab window of the __data step__
    + Record the __stepId__ and __workflowId__ of this __data step__
    + Get data using the tercen api `tercen::ctx$select`
    + Execute the __operator app__ locally 
    + Push results back to Tercen using the tercen API `tercen::ctx$save`
  
The actions above may happen multiple times as you develop your operator. Once the __operator app__ is finalized then proceed:

__Deploy the operator__:

* Modify `workshop.R` and copy it to `main.R` 
* Run `packrat::init`
This can always re-init packrat by performing the following
    + Remove the `packrat` folder in the Rstudio project folder
    + Remove the `.Rprofile` file in the project folder
    + Run `packrat::init` again
* upload to github in a public repository, let call it the operator git repo.


The process steps for building a __operator app__ using R:

* Design the __operator__
* Decide which existing operator to clone from Tercen __app-library__
* Clone an existing __operator__ from the Tercen github
* Re-init the git
* Remove packrat
* Modify the code for __operator__
* Run it locally until satisfied
* Add some tests
* Add documentation
* Init renv
* Create and push to a git repository
* Install it into Tercen from __app-library__
* Test it on data
* Notify the community it exists (see below)

The building and deployment steps are performed in your development environment (e.g. R Studio) and Git hub.

All the operators apps are version controlled.

All __operator apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.

## Notify the community {-}

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the __operators app__  git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
