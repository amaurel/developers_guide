# Setting up Tercen Studio

If you wish to develop __operators__ then you require to have a programming development environment.

If you are a regular programmer then you already have your environment.

For __templates__ and __workflow apps__ you do not need a development environment as Tercen contains all the features required to build them.

## Installing Tercen Studio {-}

**1. Install docker-compose**

First you need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**Important**: Make sure the _Enable Hyper-V Windows Features_ option is selected on the Configuration page.


**For Mac and Linux:**

Check out [how to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on Mac or Linux.

Then, __get tercen-studio__ by cloning the following repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tercen/tercen_studio.git
cd tercen_studio
```
