# Building an operator app

Lets go through a general approach to create an R operator for Tercen. A more detailed walk through (a tutorial) example is outlined in the next chapter where a linear regression operator is built from scratch.

Building an operator requires the following sequential steps: 

* Design the operator
* Setup the github repository
* Setup the input projection
* Connecting to Tercen
* Testing 
* Managing input parameters
* Managing R packages
* Deploy


## Design the operator {-}

The first step is to define our __input projection__ and __output relation__. In Tercen, each operator shall take as input a table and return a table. Remember:

> "__Table in, table out!__"

To understand the input table and the output table. The input table is defined by the data __input projection__ in Tercen and output table is what is computed by the operator. The output table is related to the input table by an __output relation__.  

The __input project__ is the projection in the data step which is used by the operator. For example a projection is composed of the `y-axis`, `x-axis`, `row`, `col`, `color`, `label`. This input project determines what is the structure of the data which is given to the operator. An operator which computes a simple `mean` would use a `y-axis`, `row`, `col` projection. This allows the `mean` to be computed per cell. A linear regression operator like `lm` might use a projection with `y-axis`, `x-axis`, and `row`, `col`. This allows the `lm` to be computed per cell. 


The __output relation__ is the relation of the calculated output to the input values. For example:

* Is the relation per Cell?
* Is the relation per Col or Row? 
* Is the relation for All the data?


__Per Cell__ example : Let's say the operator used a projection with `row` and `col` and the operator calculates a `mean` per row/col (i.e. per cell), this would be a per cell relationship.

__Per Col__ example: Let's say the operator used a project with `row` and `col` and the operator performed a clustering on the columns, this would be a column relationship.

__for All__ data example: Let's say the operator used a project with `row` and `col` and the operator calculated a total `mean` of all the data (i.e. across all rows and cols), this would be an all data relationship.


## Set up a GitHub project {-}

All operators currently are developed on github. It is necessary to have a github account. Each operator is implemented as a separate repository therefore you require to create a repository for your operator. The quickest method is the use the template feature in github, where, at the moment of repository creation you can choose to use a template, currently we have three pre-defined templates.

* [template for r operators](https://github.com/tercen/template_R_operator)
* [template for shiny r operators](https://github.com/tercen/template_shinyr_operator)
* [template for docker operators](https://github.com/tercen/template_docker_operator)

It is important to choose a good name for your operator repository, see \@ref(naming)


**Steps for starting with the operator repository**

* Get github account
* Choose an operator name
* Create an operator repository on github based on a template (see above)
* Clone the repo into the local Rstudio contained in tercen studio

## Setup the input data {-}

This can be done in the local or a cloud instance of Tercen.

* Login to Tercen (either local or cloud)
* Prepare your data by defining a __cross-tab__ projection using a __data step__.
* Note that the project in the data step has URL with this pattern: `/w/workflowId/ds/stepId`, where `workflowId` and `stepId` are __unique workflow and data step identifiers__, respectively. These identifiers will be used in the next step to get data from this data step.

## Connecting to tercen {-}

Once you have cloned the github operator project into your local RStudio and you have setup the Tercen data projection, we can code and test our operator locally.

If you wish to test with the local version of Tercen, then you do not require to set the `tercen.service` system variable. 

* Load some data up in the 
* Each data step has a unique`workflowId` and a `stepId` combination.

```
options("tercen.workflowId"= "8a8845f6a5eeff27ce33fd382444de88")
options("tercen.stepId"= "5191724b-3963-4e34-af58-7977cc61e5b1")
```

___Connecting to tercen cloud___

Additional system variable are required in order to connect to a data step in the tercen cloud.

```
options("tercen.serviceUri"= "https://tercen.com/api/v1/")
options("tercen.username"= "uuuu")
options("tercen.password"= "pppp")
```

Where `uuuu` is the username and `pppp` is the password, these are specific to your username and password.


## Managing input parameters {-}

The operator has a file called `operator.json` these define the parameters which the user can set when using your operator.

Before deploying, please think what parameters are required and modify this file.


## Managing R packages {-}

The operator manages its packages using the `renv` system.
To generate this use:


`renv::init()` 



Before deployment.



## Deploy! {-}

Once you are satisfied with your operator, you can release it.

**Document the operator**

Edit the `README.md` to describe the operator design and usage. The documentation should contain:

* A __general description__ of the operator

* A description of the __input projections__

* A description of the __output relations__

**Prepare operator testing**

It's always good to prepare some unit tests that could be ran when a new version of Tercen is released.

To include a test, you need to __create a `test` subdirectory__ in your project directory. It must include:

* a test __input file__

* an expected __output file__

* a __`JSON` file__ containing information about the test

**Initiate package version control**

The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. In order to ensure reproducibility, you can associate packages and their versions to your operator by initiating a project-local environment with a private libraries in a subdirectory.

**Push it to your GitHub repository**

Once everything is ready, you simply need to push all the modifications to the GitHub repository that you created before.

If you want to install it directly from `Tercen`, you will need to [create a release in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository). All the operators apps are version controlled.

All __operator apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.

**Notify community**

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the __operators app__ git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
