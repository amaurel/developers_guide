# Building an operator app: general procedure

Here we will learn through a concrete example how to create an R operator for Tercen. Our goal is to create an operator performing a __linear regression__ on our input data and returning the slope and intercept of the model.

## Design the operator {-}

The first step is to define our __input projection__ and __output relation__. In Tercen, each operator shall take as input a table and return a table. Remember:

> "__Table in, table out!__"

The **operator model** can be seen as follow:

## Set up a project from a template {-}

**1. Create a GitHub repository from a template**

* __Create a new GitHub repository__ with your own account based on a Tercen operator template that you can find on GitHub (https://github.com/tercen/).

* Then you can create your own repository based on this template. Choose an explicit name.

* Now that the repository is initiated in your GitHub account, you can work on it locally, using tercen-studio for example.

**2. Set up the Tercen input projection**

* Start Tercen locally and set up the desired projection with a data step.

* Note that the data step URL includes this pattern: `/w/WORKFLOWID/ds/DATASTEPID`, where `WORKFLOWID` and `DATASTEPID` are __unique workflow and data step identifiers__, respectively. These identifiers will be used in the next step to get data from this data step.

## Code and test locally {-}

Now that our RStudio project and Tercen projection are set up, we can code and test our operator locally.

* Using `tercen-studio`, code your operator

* __Execute the code__ and __check the results__ in Tercen using the data step and workflow IDs taken from the Tercen data step URL

## Deploy! {-}

Once you are satisfied with your operator, you can release it.

**Document the operator**

Edit the `README.md` to describe the operator design and usage. The documentation should contain:

* A __general description__ of the operator

* A description of the __input projections__

* A description of the __output relations__

**Prepare operator testing**

It's always good to prepare some unit tests that could be ran when a new version of Tercen is released.

To include a test, you need to __create a `test` subdirectory__ in your project directory. It must include:

* a test __input file__

* an expected __output file__

* a __`JSON` file__ containing information about the test

**Initiate package version control**

The ability to run an operator with exactly the same packages you used when you developed is essential for reproducible science. In order to ensure reproducibility, you can associate packages and their versions to your operator by initiating a project-local environment with a private libraries in a subdirectory.

**Push it to your GitHub repository**

Once everything is ready, you simply need to push all the modifications to the GitHub repository that you created before.

If you want to install it directly from `Tercen`, you will need to [create a release in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository). All the operators apps are version controlled.

All __operator apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.

**4. Notify community**

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the __operators app__ git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
