# Creating a shiny operator app

It is easy to create a shiny operator. It is exactly like the creating a standard operator but it uses a the shiny framework.

An example of a simple shiny is found at:

https://github.com/tercen/heatmap_shiny_operator


A shiny app can be in three modes, these modes reflect the three states of a shiny operator.

* show
* run
* showResult

The first mode "show" is when the initial mode when an shiny operator is added to the cross-tab view
The second mode "run" is when the shiny has been executed
The third mode "showResult" is when the results of the an excuted shiny is presented.

A good example of all three modes go to
