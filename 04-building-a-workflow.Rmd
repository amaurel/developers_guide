# Building a workflow app

The process for building a workflows app is:

* Design the __workflow app__
* Create a __workflow app__ in Tercen
* Insert Wizard step (optional)
* Replace the initial Table step with Input step
* Add a final Output step
* Save it
* Go to the properties and set it as an app
* Test it in a workflow with data
* Notify the community of its existence (see below)

All the building and deployment processes are performed in Tercen.

All __workflow apps__ who are on a git repository are installable, only the git URL and a tag version number is required for a researcher to install it in Tercen.

## Notify the community {-}

Currently, we ask you to send an email to info@tercen.com containing the description and link to the workflow app git repository, Tercen support will manually test it and add it to the __app-library__ and thus allowing others to access it. We are currently building an web entry point for researchers to browse all the apps offered by the community.
