# Naming guidelines {#naming}

The art of naming is fundamental to programming and here are some guidelines to help

## Operator naming guidelines {-} 

Here are some examples of naming operators

+    `median_operator`
+    `som_flowsom_operator` , here the `som` is from the R package `flowsom`
+    `boxplot_shiny_operator`, it is using R shiny
+    `worldmap_shiny_docker_operator`, it is using R shiny and docker

These examples follow naming guidelines, the recommended structure of an operator name is:

`function_package_shiny_docker_operator`

It is essentially a list of parts separated by an underscore.

Where `function` and `operator` is always indicated and the rest depends on the operator context.

\

A breakdown of the different parts are:

`function` is the function name, usually from R function name

`package` is the package or module name

`shiny`  is if the operator is uses R shiny

`docker` is if the operator uses a docker

`operator` is if is an operator

\




Please make sure the git repo description outlines a brief functional description of the operator. e.g. `calculates a median`
